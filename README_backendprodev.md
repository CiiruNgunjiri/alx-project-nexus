# üìò Project Nexus ‚Äì Backend Engineering Documentation Hub

## Overview

**Project Nexus** is a documentation repository created as part of the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**.  
It consolidates my major learnings over 3 months, serving as a **knowledge hub** for backend technologies, concepts, and best practices.  

This repository is not a single project, but rather a reflection and documentation of my journey through building multiple backend systems ‚Äî including a travel app, an Airbnb clone, messaging app, and various security and DevOps projects.  

---

## üéØ Project Objective
The objective of Project Nexus is to:  
- Consolidate key learnings from the ProDev Backend Engineering program.  
- Document major backend technologies, concepts, challenges, and solutions.  
- Serve as a reference guide for backend learners.  
- Foster collaboration between frontend and backend learners by clearly documenting APIs, workflows, and integration points.  

---

## üõ† Key Technologies Covered
- **Python** 
‚Äì Core backend programming language for all projects. 
- Built APIs, background tasks, and automation scripts.  
- Emphasized clean, modular, and testable code with **PEP 8 standards**.   

---

### **Django & Django REST Framework (DRF)**
- Created scalable backend applications like the **Travel App** and **Airbnb Clone**.  
- **Django ORM** simplified database queries and migrations.  
- **DRF** was used to build RESTful APIs with serializers and viewsets.  

---

### **REST APIs**
- Designed stateless APIs for **listings, bookings, reviews, and messaging systems**.  
- Focused on **versioning, authentication, and rate limiting**.  
- Example:  
  ```http
  GET /api/v1/listings/
  POST /api/v1/bookings/ { "listing_id": 1, "user_id": 5, "dates": "2025-09-10" }

---

- **GraphQL APIs** 
- Implemented a CRM system with GraphQL to allow flexible queries.
- Learners could fetch exactly what they needed in one request.
- Example query:
{
  customer(id: 1) {
    name
    email
    orders {
      product
      status
    }
  }
}

---

- **Docker** 
‚Äì Containerized apps to ensure consistent development and deployment.
- Example: A Django app + PostgreSQL DB packaged into Docker containers.
- Learned to write Dockerfiles, docker-compose configurations, and manage multi-container services.

---

- **CI/CD Pipelines** 
- Automated testing and deployment workflows.
- Used GitHub Actions to:
- Run test suites on every push.
- Deploy updates seamlessly.
- Example workflow:
Push ‚Üí Run Tests ‚Üí Build Docker Image ‚Üí Deploy

## üß© Important Backend Development Concepts
# Database Design: 
- Designed relational schemas for Users, Listings, Bookings, Reviews.
- Focused on normalization (avoiding redundancy) and foreign key relationships.
- Learned migrations using Django ORM.

# Asynchronous Programming:
- Used Celery with RabbitMQ to process background tasks (e.g., anomaly detection, sending notifications).
- Prevented blocking the main application during heavy tasks.

# Caching Strategies: 
- Used Redis to cache frequently requested data (like property listings).
- Reduced response times and lowered database load.
- Example: Caching listing search results.

# System Design
- Learned to design scalable systems by splitting concerns into services:
 * Auth service
* API service
* Task queue
* Database
* Discussed load balancing, horizontal scaling, and monitoring.

# Security

- Built Django middleware for:
  * IP logging and tracking suspicious activity.
  * Rate limiting to prevent abuse.
  * Blacklisting IPs and anomaly detection.
- Ensured API authentication using tokens and session management.

## ‚ö° Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge:** Managing complex database relationships.  
  - **Solution:** Used Django ORM best practices and normalized schema design.  

- **Challenge:** Handling high traffic and performance bottlenecks.  
  - **Solution:** Implemented Redis caching, optimized queries, and added rate limiting.  

- **Challenge:** Coordinating background tasks like anomaly detection.  
  - **Solution:** Integrated Celery with RabbitMQ for distributed task execution.  

- **Challenge:** Ensuring consistent dev/prod environments.  
  - **Solution:** Used Docker to containerize services and avoid environment mismatches.  

---

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Best Practices & Personal Takeaways
- Always write clean and modular code with clear documentation.
- Secure endpoints with authentication, authorization, and input validation.
- Use environment variables (.env files) for sensitive configurations.
- Automate deployments with CI/CD.
- Collaborate effectively with frontend peers by documenting API endpoints.
- Embrace testing ‚Äî even small unit tests help catch regressions.
- Document learnings: Future learners benefit from clear explanations of concepts.
